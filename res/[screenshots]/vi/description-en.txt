KCals is designed to help you control your calorie intake. Whether you want to maintain, lose, or gain weight, this application will help you focus on what’s important: your calorie balance.
The idea is simple. Define a goal ("daily calories") and keep yourself "balanced" in the context of this goal. The app will indicate when you’ve eaten too much ("surplus"), or too little ("deficit").
Calories from food will be added to the total. Calories burned (including exercise) will be subtracted from the total.
Elapsed time is converted into calories burned. Therefore, your caloric balance will be reduced automatically throughout the day. Think of it in terms of fuel consumption.
If you overeat, you can compensate by doing exercises or eating less over the next few hours.
Check your Profile. There you will find all the information needed to determine your ideal calorie intake.

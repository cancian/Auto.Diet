KCals is designed to help you control your calorie intake. Whether you want to maintain, lose, or gain weight, this application will help you focus on what’s important: your caloric balance.
The idea is simple. Define a goal (daily calories) and keep yourself Balanced in the context of this goal. The app will indicate when you’ve eaten too much (surplus), or too little (deficit)
Calories from food will be added to the total. Calories burned (including exercise) will be subtracted from the total.
Elapsed time is converted into calories burned. Therefore, your caloric balance will be reduced automatically throughout the day. This simulates your metabolic rate.
If you overeat, you can compensate by doing exercises or eating less over the next few hours.
Check your Profile to determine your ideal calorie intake.

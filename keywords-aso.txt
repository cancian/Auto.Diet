Track your calorie intake and usage in real-time with ChronoBurn! Whether you’re trying to lose or gain weight, ChronoBurn helps you keep on track and achieve your weight or fitness goals by counting your food calorie intake, calories burned and total calorie target for the day.

----------------------------------
HOW DOES IT WORK?
----------------------------------
ChronoBurn works like a calorie chronometer and it’s super simple to use, showing you how much to eat every day depending on your fitness or weight goals. 

• Set your total calorie target for the day or check your profile to determine your ideal calorie intake
• Log your food – ChronoBurn will add to the total calorie intake
• Log your exercise – any calories burned will be subtracted from your total intake
• Elapsed time is converted into calories burned to simulate your metabolic rate

The aim is to keep the calorie counter as close to zero as possible by logging your food and exercise. Just set your daily calorie intake, hit start and you’re good to go! 

Losing, gaining or maintaining weight has never been easier!

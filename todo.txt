The app "keeps running" because it's simulating the way your body works.
Your metabolism never stops using calories. You must burn calories to stay alive, and it is a continuous process.
Since the app takes that into consideration, it must behave that way.
Personally, I think of the app more like a metabolism simulator than a calorie counter. It helps you to "keep in sync" with your body.
About the other question: Yes, it is a one-time charge. And you can also use the web version at kcals.net for free, so you can update your stuff from your desktop browser.
Let me know if you have any other questions.
Best regards
André Cancian

Okay, thanks for the notes. I'll work on that.
By the way, if you find the Swedish version of the db too annoying, you can just switch the app language to English, and then re-import the food database. This will cause the current DB items to be replaced by the original English names.
After that, you can switch the app language back to Swedish without affecting the database contents. All items will remain in English, as long as you don't re-import the database again while using another display language.
Assuming you speak English fluently, that should temporarily ease your pain with the poor translation.

KCals Calorie Counter - Cordova Cross-Platform App
====================================================
This project is now open source. The code is free for personal use only. For commercial purposes, authorization is required.

PROJECT STATUS:
I'm currently trying to port the App to Apple Watch, Google Watch, and Android widgets. A more distant goal is an integration with the iOS Health Kit.
If you'd like to help make this happen, drop me a line at cancian@ateus.net
